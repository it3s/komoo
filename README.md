This is the Mootiro Maps 2 repo

We are re-building the http://maps.mootiro.org web app from scratch.

The master branch is stable, which means that is always behind the develop branch.
Our workflow is always work on topic branch and merge it on develop.
Every two weeks we merge these changes into the master, for now the master branch  means 'staging' for us.

In the future, when we release it publicly,master will become production, and we will have a extra step for staging.

More info about what the project is you can find in http://maps.mootiro.org.
More info about how the project is build, and how to help, on the wiki.
